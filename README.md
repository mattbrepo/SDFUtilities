# SDFUtilities
Utilities for [Chemical table files (aka SDF or MDL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_table_file)

**Language: Python**

**Start: 2021**

## Why
Dealing with SDF / MDL files on a daily basis. I put together a few useful utilities:

- sdf_count.py: counts the number of molecules in a SDF file
- sdf_split.py: splits a SDF file into smaller SDF files with x number of molecules
- sdf_to_csv.py: puts molecule data from a SDF file into a CSV file
